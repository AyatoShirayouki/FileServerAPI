Cohort analysis in simple terms is like following a group of students (the cohort) from the time they enter school (start using a product) to see how they progress over time. The aim is to observe particular patterns, like whether they tend to participate more in class (engage with a product) or if they sign up for extra classes (upgrade services).

In the context of a product, let’s break down the steps for the functions you’re asking for:

User Increase Function: This would track new users joining each month and compare the numbers to see if there’s an increase.

Product Stats Function: This function would gather data like user engagement, sales, upgrades, or any other key performance indicators (KPIs) for each month.

Integrated Analysis Function: This would combine the user increase data with product stats to see if there's a correlation between an increase in users and the product's performance stats for that month.

Here’s a professional explanation of how these functions could work together:

Monthly User Growth Analysis: We segment our users based on their sign-up month and then track the count of new users each subsequent month. This allows us to see not just raw growth numbers, but also to understand the growth rate – whether our user base is expanding faster or slowing down.

Monthly Product Performance Stats: For each cohort, we analyze various metrics such as average session length, number of transactions, revenue generated, and so on. This provides a snapshot of how active and valuable the users are in any given month.

Correlation Analysis: We then correlate the user growth data with product performance metrics. For instance, if we see a spike in new users in June, we check our product stats for June. If there’s a corresponding increase in engagement or revenue, we can infer that the new users are contributing positively to the product’s success.

Cohort Trend Analysis: By looking at trends over multiple cohorts, we can identify patterns and anomalies. For example, if the engagement drops but user growth is steady, there may be an issue with user retention or product-market fit.

The combination of these analyses offers valuable insights. If user growth and product stats are both increasing, it indicates a healthy and growing product. If there’s an increase in users but a decrease in engagement, we may need to investigate if the product is meeting the needs of the new users, or if there might be issues with onboarding or user experience.

To summarize, these functions and their integrated analysis are crucial for understanding not just growth, but sustainable growth – ensuring that new users are finding value in the product and contributing to its overall success.
